= Setting up IPMI using ipmitool =

This is roughly based on http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=26913861 .

# Connect the management interface to the network before powering your machine on if you have a dedicated interface for it; if not, connect to the first onboard interface on the chassis.
# Boot your OS.
# Load the ipmi kernel module for the system (kldload ipmi for FreeBSD, modprobe ipmi for Linux, etc).

'''Notes''':
* The following blurb sets your machine's BMC up to talk on a 192.168.20.0/24 network, where the gateway is 192.168.20.1 and the IP address it can be accessed at is 192.168.20.2. You can substitute 'ipsrc static' with 'ipsrc dhcp' if you  wish to use DHCP.
* Adjust the following settings to meet your needs, and see the ipmitool manpage for more details.
* You may have to power off your machine and disconnect all power after issuing the following commands if the BMC is unpingable via the configured address below (192.168.20.2, etc).

Setting up the BMC with a static address (192.168.20.2/24 and a default gateway of 192.168.20.1):

 ipmitool lan set 1 ipsrc static
 ipmitool lan set 1 ipaddr 192.168.20.2
 ipmitool lan set 1 netmask 255.255.255.0
 ipmitool lan set 1 defgw ipaddr 192.168.20.1

Setting up the BMC with a dynamic address:

 ipmitool lan set 1 ipsrc dhcp

The rest of the setup steps are as follows:

 # The user id for the administrator account. See the product specific BMC spec for
 # the implementation; it may vary.
 ADMIN_ACCOUNT_USER_ID=2
 ADMIN_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD="ADMIN"
 ADMIN_ACCOUNT_USERNAME="ADMIN"
 # See the "user priv" section under ipmitool(1) for more details
 readonly ADMINISTRATOR_PRIV=4
 # The unique channel number to talk to the BMC; see:
 # https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/IPMI_Basics#Channel_Model
 readonly IPMI_CHANNEL=1
 # turn on lan access
 ipmitool lan set $IPMI_CHANNEL access on
 # sleeping 1 second is required as the first command might not always work
 sleep 1
 ipmitool lan set $IPMI_CHANNEL access on
 # Setup necessary auth methods
 ipmitool lan set $IPMI_CHANNEL auth USER "MD2,MD5"
 ipmitool lan set $IPMI_CHANNEL auth OPERATOR "MD2,MD5"
 ipmitool lan set $IPMI_CHANNEL auth ADMIN "MD2,MD5"
 ipmitool lan set $IPMI_CHANNEL auth CALLBACK "MD2,MD5"
 # Allow the BMC to be pingable
 ipmitool lan set $IPMI_CHANNEL arp respond on
 # Let the BMC generate ARP packets
 ipmitool lan set $IPMI_CHANNEL arp generate on
 ipmitool user set name $ADMIN_ACCOUNT_USER_ID $ADMIN_ACCOUNT_USERNAME
 # Set the administrator account password
 ipmitool user set password $ADMIN_ACCOUNT_USER_ID "$ADMIN_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD"
 # Give the account administrator account on the designated IPMI channel.
 # NB: This is likely redundant.
 ipmitool user priv $ADMIN_ACCOUNT_USER_ID $ADMINISTRATOR_PRIV $IPMI_CHANNEL
 # Enable the adminstrator account.
 ipmitool user enable $ADMIN_ACCOUNT_USER_ID
 # Turn on serial over lan (SOL)
 #
 # NB: This more often than not fails under FreeBSD. The failure as far as I
 # can tell this is benign.
 ipmitool sol set enabled true
