The goal of this testcase and driver is to do targeted, functional testing of
memguard.

The driver intentionally leaks memory to test certain scenarios.

The different flags that are tested are:

#define MG_GUARD_AROUND         0x001
#define MG_GUARD_ALLLARGE       0x002
#define MG_GUARD_NOFREE         0x004

These are bitmask values set via `vm.memguard.options` and currently aren't
mutually exclusive.

Knobs that can be used to validate the functionality are:

- vm.memguard.fail_kva
- vm.memguard.fail_pgs
- vm.memguard.numalloc

Notes:
- Double-frees cause memguard || sys/vm panics if invariants are enabled
  (see PR # 192098 for relevant discussion). XXX: how will I test this without
  RUMP or a VM?
