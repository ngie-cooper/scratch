The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how one could write a "C" driver
for interfacing with a library that is in turn driven by an atf-sh script for
graybox testing purposes. The goal is to demonstrate how it could be simpler to
write a shell script for testing instead of a C application when doing trivial
testing tasks

Building the example:

% make obj
% make depend
% make all
% mtree -deU -f BSD.tests.dist -p /usr/tests
% make install
