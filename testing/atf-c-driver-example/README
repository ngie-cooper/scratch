The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how one could write a "C" driver
for interfacing with a library that is in turn driven by an atf-sh script for
graybox testing purposes and to demonstrate how it could be simpler to write a
shell script for testing instead of a C/C++ application when doing trivial
testing tasks like this. Caveat being of course that sh is a loosely typed
language and C/C++ are strong typed languages.

Building the example:

% make obj
% make depend
% make all
% mtree -deU -f BSD.tests.dist -p /usr/tests
% make install
