This demo provides an idea of how one could use tests.txz from
release CDs, etc if they're under a bit of a space crunch on
their root media. The demo remounts the filesystem readonly after
it's been populated with the files from usr-tests.txz .

1. Run create_usr_tests_md.sh.
2. Copy over usr-tests.size.txt and usr-tests.txz to /var
3. Run ./modify_etc_fstab.sh as root.
4. Run ./modify_etc_rc_conf.sh as root.
5. Run 'service mdconfig start' and 'service mdconfig2 start'
   as root, or reboot your machine.
