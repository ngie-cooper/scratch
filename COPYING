Not like this probably matters all that much, but this collection of scripts
and other docs/references are distributed under BSD 2-clause license unless
noted otherwise. All I ask is that you honor the license when copying my
stuff, and please attach the following boilerplate when moving my code around,
unless there's already a license attached to the file of interest.

Enjoy!
